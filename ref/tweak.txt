Firestore rules tweak (so vendor can query + customer can update safely)

In your Firestore Rules, for publicTracking/{token} you should allow updates (already true in your earlier rules) but ensure you don’t over-restrict. This app updates these keys:

status, updatedAt, createdAt

customerName, orderId

address, tracking, paid

photos, messages

lastUpdateBy, lastCustomerActivityAt, vendorLastSeenAt

So make sure your changedKeys allowlist includes those.
